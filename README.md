# Meteor Foundation-5-scss

An atmosphere smart package for foundation 5 that can work along side a custom scss compass installation. Based on on the work of [Connor Atherton](http://connoratherton.com) \( [https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/meteor-foundation-5](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/meteor-foundation-4.9) \)

You must compile and set up your own .css files with compass for this to work. See the demo meteor app for details.
